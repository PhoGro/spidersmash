Learning Swift and Spritekit by making a small game.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

SpiderSmash is currently optimized using an iPhone X. It will not run well inside of Xcode's simulator so I'd suggest running this on a device. I'll be looking at optimization for iPhone 6/7/8 size screens in the near future, but I do not have access to plus size screens so any help there would be wonderful!

# Overview

SpiderSmash is a simple 2D SpriteKit game I have been building as a way to learn Swift and SpriteKitas a personal challenge of mime. The goal is to continue to work to polish the current game to a point where it runs smoothly and has a bit more depth in terms of combat and progression. 

# If you want to help

Please feel free to help me learn. I'm most interested in learning how to optimize the core game play of the game and combat mechnaics. I'd love to build some sort of hero progression (experience/skill tree/etc) into the game. I'm also interested in what it would take to create boss encounters and expanding the world design to more levels.

# Designer Wanted

If you're a graphic designer looking to do some volunteer work I certainly wouldn't turn down any help!
